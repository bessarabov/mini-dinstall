    an existing file with that name.  Users of Real File Systems were not
    affected :)

  * debian/rules:
    - Update to latest version of Colin's Build System.

mini-dinstall (0.2.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Remove Build-Depends on python and python-logging (Closes: #166660).
    - Add Build-Depends on debhelper. 
  * debian/rules:
    - Use Colin's Build System.
  * Don't install CVS directories in doc dir (Closes: #166286).
  * Add Makefile.
  * Add the beginnings of a new spiffy XML manual.
  * Convert SGML manpage into XML.  Now just point users to the manual.

mini-dinstall (0.2.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Pass keychain options down to ArchiveDirs.  It would be nice if Python
    had a real compiler which allowed one to check for these kinds of
    errors.  I mean, I like Python (especially the syntax) and all, but
    why does "scripting language" imply "no static type analysis" and "no
    lexical variable analysis"?  Other languages like Dylan handle this
    really elegantly, by allowing OPTIONAL type declarations.
    Unfortunately the Gwydion Dylan implementation doesn't have stuff like
    threading yet.  But maybe someday I will rewrite mini-dinstall in it.
    Or invent my own non-sucky programming language...but for now, this
    (Closes: #165163).

 -- Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>  Thu, 17 Oct 2002 16:28:31 -0400

mini-dinstall (0.2.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changes by Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>:
    - Fixed logic to determine whether to generate Packages and Sources
      files.
    - Removed a shebang line from a module (makes lintian happy).
  * Change documentation to refer to 'verify_sigs' instead of
    'verify_signatures' (Closes: #164992).

 -- Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>  Wed, 16 Oct 2002 11:05:09 -0400

mini-dinstall (0.2.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Turn per-distribution options poll_time, max_retry_time, and
    mail_on_success into integers.
  * Print mode change in octal.

 -- Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>  Tue, 15 Oct 2002 13:01:23 -0400

mini-dinstall (0.2.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix algorithm for calculating old packages.  It was totally broken.
    This should really fix #163449.
  * Fix typo in exception handler for _install_run_scripts.
  * Don't use ACCEPT directory; just put .changes in the toplevel
    directory, but chmod them 600 to prevent other people from uploading
    the packages.

 -- Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>  Tue, 15 Oct 2002 11:51:25 -0400

mini-dinstall (0.2.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove all older files with the same names as files in an upload, not
    just ones with the same name as the source package (Closes: #163449).
  * Fix flat mode; Sorry, joeyh!  I promise to test it in the future.
  * Don't needlessly generate Packages/Sources files if the mtime on the
    directory is older than the files.
  * Use "foo in map.keys()" instead of just the much cooler "foo in map"
    to be compatible with Python 2.1 (which is what's in woody).

 -- Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>  Mon, 14 Oct 2002 01:48:04 -0400

mini-dinstall (0.2.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Default to "simple-subdir" archive style again.  We do plan to default
    to "flat" in version 0.3.0, but the change shouldn't have been made
    yet.

 -- Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Oct 2002 09:57:08 -0400

mini-dinstall (0.2.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The "hopefully Roland won't mailbomb me again :)" release.
  * Don't install packages in a separate thread; instead, install them
    from the incoming thread (Closes: #164323).  It wasn't a useful
    optimization, and caused bugs.  We do keep around the indexing
    threads, however.
  * Default to not use dnotify; it is unreliable (Closes: #164387).
  * Add better error checking when running md5sum; I think along with the
    above changes this will avoid crashing when verifying md5sum output
    (Closes: #164297).
  * Don't try to call strerror attribute when handling an error
    (Closes: #162923).

 -- Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Oct 2002 00:49:23 -0400

mini-dinstall (0.2.9) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Try not to delete the .orig.tar.gz if we're making Debian-revision
    only update (Closes: #159500).

 -- Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Sep 2002 20:42:54 -0400

mini-dinstall (0.2.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Just depend on python-logging, not python2.1-logging.
  * Don't crash when appending .changes to screwed list.

 -- Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>  Sun,  1 Sep 2002 23:06:55 -0400

mini-dinstall (0.2.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Test whether the Distribution: field exists before assuming a .changes
    is ready.  Why it would fail to to exist is beyond me.  Hopefully this
    will work around the bug until we find the root cause.
  * Ensure .changes with an unknown Distribution get added to the screwed
    list.

 -- Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>  Sun,  1 Sep 2002 14:53:51 -0400

mini-dinstall (0.2.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Test whether a process in the lockfile pid exists before locking
    (Thanks Ivo Timmermans <ivo@o2w.nl> for the hint).
  * Don't delay in killing an existing process.

 -- Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Aug 2002 20:01:45 -0400

      mode.

 -- Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Aug 2002 00:43:33 -0400

mini-dinstall (0.2.3) staging; urgency=low

  * Just Recommend: debian-keyring.

 -- Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Aug 2002 00:39:20 -0400

mini-dinstall (0.1.9) staging; urgency=low

  * Allow for multiple archive styles; currently "simple-subdir" and
    "flat"; this is the config opt "archive_style".

 -- Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>  Mon, 19 Aug 2002 16:38:33 -0400

mini-dinstall (0.1.1) staging; urgency=low

  * Use relative filenames in Packages file.
  * Don't install extra cruft in the doc dir.

 -- Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>  Mon, 19 Aug 2002 15:24:53 -0400

mini-dinstall (0.1.0) staging; urgency=low

  * PRERELEASE
  * Almost complete refactoring of the code.  Now there is a real
    incoming/ directory.  This means that instead of uploading to one of
    the distribution directories, you now just upload to
    $ARCHIVEDIR/incoming, and put the distribution you want in the
    debian/changelog.
  * Support for mail_log_level = NONE
  * Support for mailing you upon installation success. 
  * First pass at a man page.
